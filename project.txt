# Stocksplosion App

### Approach

When I received your proposal of this new app, I read that the three
things you were hoping to optimize for were:
- Ease of Use
- Speed
- ROI

I will address each those areas and how I approached each item.

##### Ease of Use

"Ease of use" can mean different things to different people. I took into
consideration two parties 1) analysts and 2) developers. This
application is easy to use for analysts because it is two pages and
there it is clear what you do on each page. On the initial page there is
a large search box with which you can search by company name or label.
Then when you reach the details page the action of buy, sell or wait is
clearly displayed at the top. 

This application is easy to use for the developers who work on it after
me because it is a small app with the logic separated into
manageable segents.

##### Speed

Each page in the application, with zero work on your part, today loads
in less than a 0.5 seconds. Even the search functionality is instant. Of
course we could make this faster and get the page load speed down close
to 0.2 seconds. This would include more development time on my end and
more headaches for you when you eventually have to deploy and maintain
the hefty application. Which brings me to your last ask

##### ROI

Because, at times, chasing the dream of a perfectly fast app can waste a
lot of money and time I chose to get a reasonably fast app up and
running.  

In order to save headaches hosting I chose to make it statically hosted.
In order to save headaches in your infrastructure I chose to not
introduce new pieces to eek out a few milliseoncds. In order to save
headaches in development I chose a simple framework with a clear
codebase.

### Time Breakdown

------------------------------------------------------------
| How Time Was Spent                          | Time Spent |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Researching the project, familiarizing      |            |
| myself with the stocksplosion API, choosing |  0.5 hours |
| a frame work and hosting option             |            |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Coding of both pages                        |  1.5 hours |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Total                                       |   2  hours |
------------------------------------------------------------

At $150/hour the grand total comes to $300.
